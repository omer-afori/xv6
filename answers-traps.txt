there is no call to f and g

printf is at: 0000000000000652
"0000000000000652 <printf>:"
(line from the asm file)

ra holds next instruction address

it prints:
He110 World

x shouldnt be changed since it is printed by its value, little or small endian doesn't change anything
i should be changed: from 0x00646c72
it should change to 726c6400

it will print some garbage values? for me it was -9016
